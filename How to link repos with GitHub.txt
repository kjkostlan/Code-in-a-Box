1. Create a folder with some code in it and type "git init"; only the git cli needs to be installed (you need to *have* repo in the first place!). The github desktop tools are helpful for more complex repos.
2. Create a .gitignore from a template (i.e. https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore)
3. Create LICENSE (no extension) and paste in the liscence (A very open license: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
4. Add a README.md file
5. Make sure you are logged into GitHub.
6. Go to github in a browser and click "repositories" and create "new". Add the name and description.
6.8. Try to figure out how all this works, but once setup in an account may not need to be set up per-repo: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
7. git remote add origin <url>      # Be in folder with local repo. URL is https://github.com/<username>/my_repo.git
8. git add *
9. git commit -m "Initial commit"   # Skipping this generates obscure hard-to-decode error messages on push.
A. git branch -m main   # Slightly increases design:do ratios.
B. git push --set-upstream origin main
